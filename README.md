## C++ Guide

### Variables and Data Types

The only variable I used was my string color1 and then I set temporary variables in my statements and loops. 

### Input and Output

You are giving an option to input a answer and if your answer matches the answer I have set then you are good. 

### Decisions

When you run my test, you are giving an option to type a color you see. If you answer wrong, it'll repeat the question. 

### Iteration

My program keeps asking the question until you get it right. 

### File Input and Output

I didn't do this part because I don't understand how to.
